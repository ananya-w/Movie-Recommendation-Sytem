# Movie Recommendation System
This project implements a content-based movie recommendation system using machine learning techniques. It preprocesses movie details, including titles, genres, cast, crew, and descriptions, and extracts features such as genre information and release year. Using TF-IDF vectorization, it transforms textual data into numerical vectors and trains a machine learning model to compute cosine similarity between movies. Recommendations are generated based on user input, providing a seamless movie recommendation experience.

## Features
- Data Preprocessing: Clean and prepare the dataset for analysis.
- Feature Engineering: Extract genre, cast, crew details, and release year.
- Vectorization: Transform textual data into numerical vectors using TF-IDF.
- Machine Learning Model: Compute cosine similarity between movies to generate recommendations.
- Usage: Clone the repository, install dependencies, preprocess data, train the model, and deploy recommendations.
